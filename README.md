# mgsv_lua_dump
This is a dump of mgsv lua code. This repository was made to keep track of TPP updates, nothing more. 

I also have other MGSV-related repos:

 * https://github.com/unknown321/mgsmonsterguns - how do the weapons work (and how to make monster guns)
 * https://github.com/unknown321/mgswaifus - unique soldiers with photos and skills and everything else
 * https://github.com/unknown321/mgsvdump - dump of lua classes used in the game, useful for modding.
